# EasyMathLife (EML)
Making school maths stress-free.
This app is aimed at solving simple and complex maths like Matlab.
It has an additional potential in that it also shows the working.
I believe that, like the makers of Matlab, that the world is getting complicated every day, leaving little or
less time to be spent on iterative mathematical calculations. You will agree with me that this is one of the 
numerous causes of overheading in college, especially for science students.
This project is open source. So everyone is invited to participate.
Feel free to improve any part of it because it is completely crude now.
You may choose to improve the GUI. However majorly, I would appreciate it if volunteers could
learn about algorithms that solve any simple or complex math, and then pull their request.

--------------REQUIREMENTS-----------------------

- Navigation sidebar/sliding tray containing subjects. On subject click, fragments with UI controls
through which calculations can be made should be shown. E.g Mathematics and Physics are example of subjects
to be contained on the sidebar.

- Navigation scrollable topbar with buttons for different topics. Each subject on the navigation sidebar
may be divided into topics and subtopics where calculation to be performed is chosen. E.g. Physics may be a
subject, whereas, radioactivity may be a topic, and half life may be a subtopic. Radioactivity should be a typical
button included in the topbar.

- Main Page (preferrable Fragment). This is where the UI controls are displayed for calculation. The UI controls
should be grouped into thin-line-bordered panels based on each subtopic. E.g. Some controls under Physics and Radioactivity may be
grouped under Half Life for Half Life based calculations, etc.

- A show workings button must be added to each navigable page for showing the solution steps of every
calculation perfomed through the EML app. On button click, user should be taken to another page (preferrably
a fragment) where the solution steps are displayed.

- A homepage. This must contain generic scientific calculator UI controls where simple arithmetic operations are 
performed with other related functions.
