# EasyMathLife
Making school maths stress-free.
This app is aimed at solving simple and complex maths like Matlab.
It hopes to add an additional advantage in that it also shows the working.
It is open source. So everyone is invited to participate.
Feel free to improve any part of it because it is completely crude now.
You may choose to improve the GUI, however majorly, I would appreciate it if our volunteers could
learn about algorithms that solve any kind of math, and include it either by sending it or coding 
and then including it right here. Thank you
